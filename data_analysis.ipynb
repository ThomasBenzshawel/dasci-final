    "### Part 1a: Data Description\n",
    "The main dataset that will be used throughout this analysis is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/steam-reviews/code. This dataset contains 6.4 million reviews from the Steam platform; users are only able to review the game if they have bought and played the game. The reviews are from 2014 to 2017. The dataset contains the following columns: `app_id`, `app_name`, `review_text`, `review_score`, `review_votes`. The definition for each column is as follows:\n",
    "* **app_id**: Unique ID of the game\n",
    "* **app_name**: Name of the game being reviewed\n",
    "* **review_text**: Text of the review\n",
    "* **review_score**: Score of the review (1 is positive, -1 is negative)\n",
    "* **review_votes**: Number of votes the review received for 'helpfulness'\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, there are 6,417,106 reviews, reviewing 9,363 unique games. The average review score is 0.6395, meaning the average review of these 9,363 games is a positive review. The average review vote score is 0.147, meaning the community does not identify most reviews as being helpful by at least one person. Also, the average number of characters per review is 304, with the smallest being 1 and the largest being 8,873. Also, interestingly, there are over 8,000 reviews which are single-character, with \".\" being the most popular at 4,885 reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, there are 631 games with ratings of 100% based on the reviews given (which is a subset of the total reviews on Steam)\n",
    "\n",
    "The datatypes of each of the different columns is as follows:\n",
    "|id|Column|Dtype|\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    " 0|app_id|int64 \n",
    " 1|app_name|object\n",
    " 2|review_text|object\n",
    " 3|review_score|int64 \n",
