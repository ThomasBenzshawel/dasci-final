ruined
my
life
.
this
will
be
more
of
a
'
'
my
experience
with
this
game
'
'
type
of
review
,
because
saying
things
like
'
'
great
gameplay
'
'
will
not
suit
something
i
'
ve
experienced
with
counter
-
strike
.
here
you
go
:
i
remember
back
in
2002
i
was
at
a
friend
'
s
house
and
he
was
playing
a
game
.
i
didn
'
t
know
the
name
of
the
game
nor
i
had
internet
to
find
it
.
a
few
weeks
passed
by
and
another
friend
came
over
.
he
didn
'
t
have
a
computer
,
so
he
brought
a
disc
with
a
game
in
it
.
he
told
me
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
games
and
from
that
very
moment
i
knew
that
it
is
going
to
be
the
game
i
saw
at
the
other
friend
'
s
house
.
when
i
saw
the
counter
-
strike
logo
i
was
filled
with
game
##gas
##m
(
?
)
and
i
was
so
happy
.
i
was
playing
it
hardcore
.
made
friends
,
clans
,
was
involved
in
communities
and
even
made
two
myself
.
counter
-
strike
is
my
first
game
which
i
played
competitive
##ly
and
it
was
a
such
an
experience
.
playing
public
servers
with
mod
##s
were
very
fun
,
but
playing
it
competitive
##ly
made
it
very
intense
and
stress
##ful
.
in
a
pleasant
way
,
of
##co
##urse
.
looking
at
the
current
e
-
sport
scene
it
might
not
seem
like
much
but
back
then
it
was
different
.
shooters
these
days
try
to
be
different
,
advanced
in
a
way
.
sometimes
the
most
simple
games
like
counter
-
strike
are
the
ones
that
live
to
this
day
.
also
,
there
are
plenty
of
mod
##s
to
keep
your
attention
to
this
game
.
the
gameplay
is
very
simple
-
defend
as
a
counter
-
terrorist
,
attack
as
a
terrorist
to
plant
the
bomb
or
save
the
hostages
as
a
ct
.
i
am
sure
most
of
you
already
know
this
and
i
doubt
there
are
gamer
##s
that
haven
'
t
heard
or
know
the
gameplay
of
counter
-
strike
,
so
i
am
sharing
here
more
of
my
experience
.
i
wish
i
could
find
my
cs
anthology
account
which
i
'
ve
lost
since
2008
.
so
,
i
decided
i
am
going
to
buy
this
game
again
and
here
you
go
-
more
than
a
thousand
hours
played
.
i
still
play
it
from
time
to
time
to
this
day
and
it
brings
back
many
great
memories
and
i
sometimes
even
stumble
upon
people
i
'
ve
played
with
years
ago
.
i
think
counter
-
strike
changed
gaming
in
a
major
way
and
we
wouldn
'
t
have
many
games
like
we
have
today
,
if
this
game
wouldn
'
t
exist
.
i
am
sure
many
of
people
already
have
played
games
like
cs
:
go
but
never
the
roots
.
i
this
game
saved
my
virginity
.
